## About
Powerbookmark is a tag-based bookmarking system that is designed for people who bookmark loads of content. 

Typical folder structures aren't adequate in some cases. Especially if you have a lot of content that falls into multiple different "categories". 

Powerbookmark lets you add these as tags, and then perform binary logic on the searches! (e.g. `(tag1 & tag2) | !tag3`)

## Installation
At the moment there is no clean way to install powerbookmark, it isn't avaliable on any extension store. 

You can clone the repo and manually add the `src/manifest.json` file.

## Planned features
This is still being actively developed, but the core functionality is there.

- [ ] Dark mode (the infrastructure for this is set up, but there is no "settings page" to access it right now)
- [ ] Passwords (the ability to lock bookmarks behind a password - the infrastructure for this is half-baked, and there is no "settings page" to activate it)
- [ ] Backups (the ability to quickly save/load text copies of a backup - or even "append backups")
- [ ] Chrome support 
- [ ] Syncing/sharing backups between devices - which would effectively allow you to sync them (mainly targeted at people who switch between mobile and desktop or different browsers frequently)
